# Hello! I'm Hugo Nakamura! 🤝

**Welcome to my GitHub page! If you're interested, check my last projects and repository (don't look so deepfully, you'll find some weird and hardcoded ones 😔)!**

Also, scrolling down you may know a little about me: my programming skills, background and incoming projects.
